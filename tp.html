                One day, I faced a problem to find a backend developer for my project and I didn't expect him/her to
                be an expert. Later, I found a guy who can do backend from my department. I spoke to him about the
                problem
                that I faced before finding him. We teamed up and started reaching out students in who face the same
                problem.
                I prepared a questionnaire for the students who had gone through the same trouble and conducted
                interview with them.

                <li>Students have some basic skills on something which cannot be considered as good at that.</li>
                <li>Those skills are not tried out until the moment comes.</li>

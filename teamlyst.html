                One day, I faced a problem to find a backend developer for my project and I didn't expect him/her to
                be an expert. Later, I found a guy who can do backend from my department. I spoke to him about the problem
                that I faced before finding him. We teamed up and started reaching out students in who face the same problem.
                I prepared a questionnaire for the students who had gone through the same trouble and conducted interview with them.

                    Students have basic skills on something and difficult to find

                After getting feedbacks from the users, we found professors also takes advantage of this platform
                to work on their idea with their college students. Again, I conducted interview with the professors and
                found that they are also willing to guide a team, if the work is based on their domain. Now, we are working
                on implementing features such as, <span class="imp">finding mentors for the project, solution for team collaboration, etc.</span>
                to make it as full-feature platform.
